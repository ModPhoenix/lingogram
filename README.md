# Lingogram

Lingogram is an innovative language learning browser extension that helps users learn new languages by highlighting words and phrases in web content. This tool aids language comprehension by color-coding words based on the user's familiarity with them.

## Features

- **Interactive Language Learning**: Users can learn in context by interacting with web content in a chosen language.

- **Word Familiarity Highlighting**: Words are color-coded to indicate user familiarity, offering a visual representation of learning progress.

- **Personal Dictionary**: Users can build their own personal dictionary that is stored on our server and accessible from any device.
